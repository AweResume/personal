      <hr>
      <p>A friend recently convinced me that I should answer a series of questions and post my answers publically on the 'about' page of my website. She said that it would provide a more accurate and genuine self-description than the bio I've included above.
        I decided to take her advice.</p>
      <p>I've adapted the questions from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/11/fashion/no-37-big-wedding-or-small.html">this</a> wonderful New York Times piece. Because the questions are largely oriented towards couples gauging their compatibility
        for one another, I've only answered a small subset of the questions.</p>
      <br>

      <h3>Given the choice of anyone in the world, whom would you want as a dinner guest?</h3>
      <p>This is very difficult to answer, and while I don't idolize people, there are a few people who immediatelly come to mind. Also, please note that the people I list below are not necessarily people that I like, but rather people who I am interested
        in learning more about (Joseph Stalin, who you'll find listed below, was not a good person and is not someone I look up to, but is still someone I'd like to meet personally).
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Malcom X</strong> // civil rights pioneer</li>
          <li><strong>Moxie Marlinspike</strong> // world-class cryptographer, programmer, and sailor</li>
          <li><strong>Richard Stallman</strong> // GNU.</li>
          <li><strong>Larry Page</strong> // co-founder of the largest global surveillance system (I still use Google Docs, though, and recognize my hypocrisy)</li>
          <li><strong>Barack Obama</strong> // among the best presidents in the history of the United States (minus the <a href="https://tbij.dronescout.org">drone</a> part)</li>
          <li><strong>Donald Trump</strong> // among the worst presidents in the history of the United States (no qualifiers needed)</li>
          <li><strong>Hillary Clinton</strong> // among the most qualified presidents (Yes, I know) in the history of the United States</li>
          <li><strong>Glenn Greenwald</strong> // groundbreaking journalist</li>
          <li><strong>Edward Snowden</strong> // former NSA, leaker</li>
          <li><strong>Joseph Stalin</strong> // Soviet leader</li>
          <li><strong>Moses+Jesus+Muhammad</strong> // their global impact is unparalleled</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h3>Before making a telephone call, do you ever rehearse what you are going to say? Why?</h3>
      <p>Sometimes. I don't go so far as to write a script, but I do like to plan in my head what I'd like to say. I do this mostly because I don't want to waste the time of the person I'm calling.</p>

      <p>When I'm calling someone for the first time, I'll usually plan my 'opening statement' before calling as well as a few talking points (just to make sure the conversation keeps moving). That being said, when I call family members, close collaborators,
        or friends, I don't take the time to plan out everything I'm going to say. When I call these people, I already know what I'd like to say, and there is room for error.
      </p>
      <br>

      <h3>When did you last sing to yourself? To someone else?</h3>
      <p>I do not have the voice of an angel. To spare the ears and sanity of those around me, I try not to sing aloud. I might make an exception for a shower every once in awhile (the sound of the shower very effectively masks the imperfections in my voice).
      </p>
      <br>

      <h3>If you were able to live to the age of 90 and retain either the mind or body of a 30-year-old for the last 60 years of your life, which would you want?</h3>
      <p>While this question invokes thought about the value of one's physical ability (and all of its elements, particularly mobility and physical ability) versus the value of one's mental ability, I think the premise is somewhat flawed: I don't believe
        that the difference in mental ability between the ages of 30 and 90 is equal to the difference in physical ability between 30 and 90.</p>
      <p>While I recognize that this is a purely qualitative comparison, I consider the mental ability of a 90 year old to be not significantly less than the mental ability of a 30 year old, provided that the person has not been affected by any sort of abnormal
        condition in their old age.
      </p>
      <p>The degradation of one's physical ability, however, seems to be much greater: most 90 year olds have trouble performing the most simple day to day tasks (for example, getting out of bed or climbing stairs).</p>
      <p>If the objective is to maximize one's fulfillment (which, to me, is strongly correlated with my productivity, which is itself strongly correlated&mdash;perhaps in equal parts&mdash;to my physical and mental ability), the clear choice is to retain
        the body of the 30 year old and simply hope that one's cognitive ability is able to widthstand the years.</p>
        <br>

      <h3>If you could change anything about the way you were raised, what would it be?</h3>
      <p>I'm extremely lucky to have had a normal and healthy childhood. I suppose the only thing I would change is the languages I was exposed to as a child. While I was <i>exposed</i> to tens&mdash;if not hundreds&mdash;of languages as a child (by virtue
        of growing up in New York City), I was raised monolingually. I would love to be able to speak other languages natively.
