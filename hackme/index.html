        <i>If you can 'hack' me, I'll give you $300.<sup>*</sup></i>
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>Consider this a challenge. Hack me, and if you contact me with the exploit you discovered, how you found it, I will pay you. There is one condition, however: you don't share the exploit you discover with anyone else and you do not exploit it on
        me beyond testing. I acknowledge that what does and does not constitute 'testing' is ambiguous and extremely subjective, but it will have to do.</p>
      <p>I will not define 'hacking,' nor will I say what does and does not count as a successful hack. What I will do, however, is give a general idea of what I mean: break into one of my online accounts or identities, discover information or data about
        me that is supposed to be private, gain partial or full access to a server under my control, or exploit any of my projects (see md-c.com). This list should give you a general idea of what I'm going for. If this were a legally binding offer I would
        be more precise, but it is not and so I won't. I will, however, keep my word.</p>
      <p>I'm offering the money because I want the value of coming forward to me with the hack to be more valuable and worthwhile than using the exploit. It also gives you plausible deniabilityâ€”you could explain why you were trying to hack me with the reward.</p>
      <small><sup>*</sup>The amount is subject to change based on the severity of the 'hack.' Based on the severity of the exploit discovered, payout may be reduced to a minimum of $50, or raised to a maximum of $1000.</small>
