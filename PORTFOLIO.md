**I am an advocate for privacy and government transparency, the founder of [Politiwatch](https://politiwatch.org), and the author of [WorthHiding.com](https://worthhiding.com). My personal website is [rmrm.io](https://rmrm.io). I will enroll at Stanford in the fall of 2020 after a gap year.**

I want to use technology to improve the world—and to learn something along the way. My research areas include digital privacy, foreign policy, government accountability, and the intersection thereof.

My projects, research, and commentary have appeared in several major news outlets including the _Washington Post,_ the _New York Times, NBC News, CNN, Foreign Affairs, the Daily Beast, Nightly News with Lester Holt, TimeOut National, New York Daily News, BoingBoing, Bustle,_ and _TimeOut New York_. My research with [Dr. Sarah Kreps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Kreps) has been presented at Yale, Columbia, Cornell, and Georgetown, among other institutions.

## Organizations
[**Politiwatch**](https://politiwatch.org): Using technology to promote political accountability, digital rights, and social awareness. (501c3 nonprofit.)

* I founded Politiwatch after I began to receive various threats for various projects I created. (See projects below.) It has protected me against legal action, allowed me to build a brand for my sites, and eased the process of receiving tax-deductible financial donations.
* Politiwatch is an American 501(c)(3) nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that advocates for freedom of information, digital privacy rights, and political accountability. It was founded in 2016 with the goal of combating political ignorance, promoting privacy, and making civic information more accessible.
* Sponsors include Google (via their Google for Nonprofits program), ProtonMail, and DigitalOcean.

[**PACTF**](https://pactf.com): a global cybersecurity competition with over 1,000 teams and $20,000 in prizes.

* After being a participant in PACTF 2016, in 2017 I became the project lead (with [Alex Reichenbach](https://github.com/Reichenbachian)).
* Managed sponsors, problem sets, advertising, and digital infrastructure (effectively the entire competition, though I couldn't have done it without help from the project mentors and the rest of the [team](https://2017.pactf.com/about/)).
* Sponsors include Amazon, J.P. Morgan, DigitalOcean, ProtonMail, Cloudflare, Carnegie Mellon University CyLab (Security and Privacy Institute), Carnegie Mellon University Information Networking Institute, and Phillips Academy Andover.
