## Research
Most of the research that I do is related to either computer science, political science, or both.

### Major Research Projects
* **Absence of Accountability: A Machine-Assisted Analysis of Legislative Engagement on US Foreign Policy**: using computers to parse the entire congressional record and study the determinants of foreign policy oversight in Congress. Co-authored with [Dr. Sarah Kreps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Kreps).
  - Source code [open source](https://github.com/milesmcc/CongressionalDroneOversight).
  - Presented at Yale, Columbia, Cornell, and UC Santa Barbara.
  - *Washington Post* popular opinion piece [here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/08/24/congress-keeps-quiet-on-u-s-drone-policy-and-thats-a-big-problem/).
  - Submitted at the _[American Political Science Review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Political_Science_Review)_ (currently under review).

### Minor Research Projects
* [**How Members of Congress Talk About the National Security Agency**](https://worthhiding.com/2017/11/21/how-legislators-talk-about-the-nsa/): a data-driven analysis of how members of Congress talk about the NSA.
* [**A Quantitative Measure of Partisan Periphery**](https://worthhiding.com/2017/10/08/a-quantitative-measure-of-partisan-periphery/): creating a mathematical (i.e. not subjective) measure of partisan periphery

## Organizations
[**Politiwatch**](https://politiwatch.org): Using technology to promote political accountability, digital rights, and social awareness. (501c3 nonprofit.)

* I founded Politiwatch after I began to receive legal and death threats for various projects I created. (See projects below.) It has protected me against legal action, allowed me to build a brand for my sites, and eased the process of receiving tax-deductible financial donations.
* Politiwatch is an American 501(c)(3) nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that advocates for freedom of information, digital privacy rights, and political accountability. It was founded in 2016 with the goal of combating political ignorance, promoting privacy, and making civic information more accessible.
* Sponsors include Google, ProtonMail, and DigitalOcean.

[**PACTF**](https://pactf.com): a global cybersecurity competition with over 1,000 teams and $20,000 in prizes.

* After being a participant in PACTF 2016, in 2017 I became the project lead (with [Alex Reichenbach](https://github.com/Reichenbachian)).
* Managed sponsors, problem sets, advertising, and digital infrastructure (effectively the entire competition, though I couldn't have done it without help from the project mentors and the rest of the [team](https://2017.pactf.com/about/)).
* Sponsors include Amazon, J.P. Morgan, DigitalOcean, ProtonMail, Cloudflare, Carnegie Mellon University CyLab (Security and Privacy Institute), Carnegie Mellon University Information Networking Institute, and Phillips Academy Andover.
