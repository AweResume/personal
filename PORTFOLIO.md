## About
**[Miles McCain](https://rmrm.io) is a student at Phillips Academy Andover. He is an advocate for privacy and government transparency, the founder of [Politiwatch](https://politiwatch.org), and the author of [WorthHiding.com](https://worthhiding.com).**

I want to use technology to improve the world—and to learn something along the way. My research areas include digital privacy, foreign policy, government accountability, and the intersection thereof.

My projects, research, and commentary have appeared in several major news outlets including the _Washington Post, NBC News, CNN, the Daily Beast, Nightly News with Lester Holt, TimeOut National, New York Daily News, BoingBoing, Bustle,_ and _TimeOut New York_. My research with [Dr. Sarah Kreps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Kreps) has been presented at Yale, Columbia, Cornell, and Georgetown, among other institutions.

* Politiwatch is an American 501(c)(3) nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that advocates for freedom of information, digital privacy rights, and political accountability. It was founded in 2016 with the goal of combating political ignorance, promoting privacy, and making civic information more accessible.

* Managed sponsors, problem sets, advertising, and digital infrastructure (effectively the entire competition, though I couldn't have done it without help from the project mentors and the rest of the [team](https://2017.pactf.com/about/)).
* Sponsors include Amazon, J.P. Morgan, DigitalOcean, ProtonMail, Cloudflare, Carnegie Mellon University CyLab (Security and Privacy Institute), Carnegie Mellon University Information Networking Institute, and Phillips Academy Andover.
