      I recently graduated from high school, and am taking a gap year before I
      start next year at Stanford. I care deeply about government
      accountability, civil liberties, and cybersecurity. To this end, I
      launched Politiwatch and a number of other projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      I want to use technology to improve the world—and to learn something along
      the way. My interests include internet freedom, cybersecurity, government
      accountability, foreign policy, and design. (They can intersect, I
      promise!)
    </p>
    <p>
      My projects, research, and commentary have appeared in several major news
      outlets including the Washington Post, the New York Times, NBC News, CNN,
      Foreign Affairs, the Daily Beast, and the Nightly News with Lester Holt.
      My research with
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Kreps">Dr. Sarah Kreps</a>
      has been presented at Yale, Oxford, Columbia, and Cornell, among other
      institutions.
