      I want to build systems that improve the worldâ€”and to learn something along
      the way. My interests include internet freedom, cybersecurity, government
      accountability, foreign policy, and design.

      My projects, research, and commentary have appeared in several major news
      outlets including the Washington Post, the New York Times, NBC News, CNN,
      Foreign Affairs, the Daily Beast, and the Nightly News with Lester Holt.
      My research with
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Kreps">Dr. Sarah Kreps</a>
      has been presented at Yale, Oxford, Columbia, and Cornell, among other
      institutions.
