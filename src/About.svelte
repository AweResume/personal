          I want to build systems that improve the worldâ€”and to learn something
          along the way. My interests include internet freedom, cybersecurity,
          government accountability, political science, and human-centered
          design.<FootnoteRef {scope} index="1" />

          My projects, research, and commentary have appeared in several major
          news outlets including the
          <i>Washington Post</i>, the
          <i>New York Times, NBC News, Foreign Affairs,</i>
          and the
          <i>Nightly News</i>
          with Lester Holt.<FootnoteRef {scope} index="2" />

            I graduated from high school in June 2019. I decided to take a gap
